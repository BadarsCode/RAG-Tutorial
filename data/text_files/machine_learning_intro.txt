Machine Learning Introduction
=============================

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that
focuses on enabling systems to learn from data and improve over time
without being explicitly programmed.

Key concepts:
- **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The model finds patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by trial and feedback.

Popular libraries:
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

Example workflow:
1. Collect data
2. Train a model
3. Evaluate performance
4. Make predictions
